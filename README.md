# 🐱‍💻 Binary Tree Traversals
📌 This program allows users to work with binary trees by performing various operations such as tree creation, traversals, 
  and additional tree operations. It provides an interactive shell interface for users to interact with the binary tree functionalities.

<br> 
  
## 🏷️ Features

### 1. Binary Tree Creation

Users can create a binary tree by specifying the values of the nodes. The program prompts the user to enter the values for each node, allowing them to build the binary tree according to their desired structure.

### 2. Tree Implementation

The binary tree is implemented using classes and objects to represent the nodes and their connections. Each node object contains a value and references to its left and right child nodes.

### 3. Tree Traversals

The program supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals to visit and print the values of the tree nodes. Users can choose their preferred traversal method, and the program will display the node values in the specified order.

### 4. Tree Visualization

The program visualizes the binary tree structure by properly indenting the nodes and displaying appropriate symbols. This helps users better understand the hierarchical arrangement of the nodes in the tree.

### 5. Tree Operations

Additional tree operations are available, including searching for a specific value in the tree and calculating the height of the tree. Users can search for a value and determine whether it exists in the tree, along with the full path to the node and its level.

## 🏷️ Usage

1. Run the program and select the desired options from the main menu.
2. Choose "Binary Tree Creation" to build a binary tree by entering the values for each node.
3. Select "Tree Traversals" to perform in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversals and view the node values in the specified order.
4. Explore the "Tree Operations" section to search for a value in the tree or calculate the height of the tree.
5. For an extra challenge, use the "Random Binary Tree Creation" option to generate a random binary tree.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions and menu prompts to interact with the program and navigate through the available features.
7. Use the appropriate menu options to go back to the main menu or exit the program.

Enjoy working with binary trees using this interactive program!
